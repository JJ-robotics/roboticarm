Files and Stuff from building my first robotic arm from scratch

Hello everyone, my name is JJ and I'm currently designing and creating my first robotic arm. 
I'm still very new to robotics so any help, tips or infos are very welcome aslong as you stay respectful.

I am using an arduino uno r3 with the sg90 servos and a 28BYJ-48 steppermotor in the base.

Enjoy!
